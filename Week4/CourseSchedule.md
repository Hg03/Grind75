[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

## Approach [Graph] :- In this approach, we simply has to check the cycle in graph ,if cycle exist return false that it is impossible to finish the courses.

We are creating a directed graph with help of this array (in form of adjacency list) like [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]]
                                             0 --------> 1
                                             1 --------> 2
                                             2 --------> 3
                                             

```cpp

```
